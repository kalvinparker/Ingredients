I'll adjust the recipe to exclude the crushed Biscoff biscuits from the filling, as requested. I'll also scale the recipe to maintain the correct proportions for the given ingredient quantities.
```python?code_reference&code_event_index=3
# Original ingredient quantities
original_cream_cheese = 250
original_double_cream = 250
original_biscoff_spread = 100
original_crushed_biscuits = 100

# Calculate the total weight of the original filling ingredients
original_total_weight = (
    original_cream_cheese
    + original_double_cream
    + original_biscoff_spread
    + original_crushed_biscuits
)

# Calculate the total weight of the new filling ingredients (without crushed biscuits)
new_total_weight = (
    original_cream_cheese + original_double_cream + original_biscoff_spread
)

# Calculate the scaling factor
scaling_factor = new_total_weight / original_total_weight

# Scale the recipe
scaled_cream_cheese = round(original_cream_cheese * scaling_factor)
scaled_double_cream = round(original_double_cream * scaling_factor)
scaled_biscoff_spread = round(original_biscoff_spread * scaling_factor)

# Display the output
print("Scaled Cream Cheese:", scaled_cream_cheese, "g")
print("Scaled Double Cream:", scaled_double_cream, "ml")
print("Scaled Biscoff Spread:", scaled_biscoff_spread, "g")
```
```text?code_stdout&code_event_index=3
Scaled Cream Cheese: 214 g
Scaled Double Cream: 214 ml
Scaled Biscoff Spread: 86 g

```
OK, here's the adjusted recipe with the crushed Biscoff biscuits removed from the filling and the quantities scaled to match your available ingredients:

## No-Bake Biscoff Cheesecake with Blackcurrant Jam (Adjusted)

**Yields:** 6 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Chill time:** 4 hours

### Ingredients:

**For the base:**
* 248g Biscoff biscuits
* 124g unsalted butter, melted (adjust if necessary to achieve desired consistency)

**For the filling:**
* 280g full-fat cream cheese, softened
* 600ml double cream
* 100g Biscoff spread

**For the topping:**
* Blackcurrant jam

### Instructions:

1. **Make the base:**
    * Crush the Biscoff biscuits into fine crumbs using a food processor or rolling pin.
    * Combine the biscuit crumbs with the melted butter in a bowl.
    * Press the mixture into the base of a springform tin or individual serving dishes.
    * Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set.

2. **Make the filling:**
    * In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth.
    * Gradually add the double cream and Biscoff spread and beat until combined.
    * Continue beating until the mixture thickens and forms soft peaks.

3. **Assemble and chill:**
    * Pour the filling over the chilled base and smooth the top.
    * Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.

4. **Serve:**
    * Top with a dollop of blackcurrant jam and enjoy!

I've increased the amount of double cream to 600ml to accommodate your available ingredients. The amount of butter needed for the base may need to be adjusted slightly depending on the desired consistency. Start with 124g (half the weight of the biscuits) and add more if needed.
