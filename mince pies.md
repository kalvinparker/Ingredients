This recipe provides a classic method for making delicious mince pies. Here's a breakdown of the steps and some helpful tips:
Ingredients:
 * For the mincemeat:
   * 1 large jar mincemeat (about 600g)
   * 2 satsumas, segmented and finely chopped
   * 1 apple, finely chopped
   * Zest of 1 lemon
   * Icing sugar for dusting
 * For the pastry:
   * 375g plain flour
   * 260g unsalted butter, softened
   * 125g caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
   * 1 large egg, plus 1 beaten egg for glazing
Instructions:
 * Make the pastry:
   * Combine flour and softened butter in a bowl. Rub together until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
   * Add caster sugar and 1 whole egg. Mix well.
   * Tip the mixture onto a lightly floured surface and gently bring it together to form a dough. Avoid overmixing.
   * Wrap the dough in cling film and chill for 10 minutes.
 * Prepare the mincemeat:
   * Combine the mincemeat, chopped satsumas, chopped apple, and lemon zest in a bowl.
 * Assemble the mince pies:
   * Preheat oven to 220°C/200°C fan/Gas 7.
   * Roll out the chilled pastry to a thickness of about 3mm.
   * Use a round cutter (about 10cm in diameter) to cut out 16 circles for the bases.
   * Place the bases into muffin tins.
   * Spoon 1½ tablespoons of the mincemeat mixture into each pastry case.
   * Brush the edges of the pastry cases with beaten egg.
   * Roll out the remaining pastry and cut out 16 circles (about 7cm in diameter) for the lids.
   * Place the lids on top of the filled pastry cases and seal the edges firmly.
   * Brush the tops of the pies with beaten egg and sprinkle with caster sugar.
   * Make a small slit in the top of each pie.
 * Bake the mince pies:
   * Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
   * Let the mince pies cool slightly in the tins before removing them.
   * Dust with icing sugar before serving.
Tips:
 * For a richer flavor, use homemade mincemeat.
 * If the pastry is too soft to handle, chill it for a few more minutes before rolling it out.
 * To ensure even baking, rotate the trays halfway through baking.
 * Store leftover mince pies in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.
Enjoy your homemade mince pies!
